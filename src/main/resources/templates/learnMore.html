                                D. M. Brancoff.In the First Balkan War of 1912 the Ottomans were defeated and driven out
                                of Macedonia (region) by the joint effort of the Balkan League (Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece
                                and Montenegro). Bulgaria annexed the town of Strumica. In the Second Balkan War (1913),

                                Bulgarian rule. On 6 April 1941, the first day of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Strumica
                                was captured by the German Army and, as Bulgaria was allied with Germany, Strumica was
                                turned over under occupation of the Bulgarian armies on 18 April 1941. From 1941 to 1944,
                                Strumica, as most of Vardar Macedonia, was annexed by the Kingdom of Bulgaria. On 11 September
                                1944 the Bulgarian army withdrew from Strumica and on 5 November 1944, the German army
                                also left the town. After the war it became part of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia,
                                one of the republics of Federal Yugoslavia. With the referendum on 8 September 1991, amid
                                the breakup of Yugoslavia, the country became independent under the constitutional name

                                <p class="foodCardDescription"> Tavce gravce has an incredibly rich flavor.
                                    It is made of boiled beans, seasoned with a roux that includes dry red pepper. The mixture is baked in a pan or skillet.
                                    Macedonians like to combine it with sausages or ribs and fresh paprika.
                                    According to the tradition, tavce gravce is usually prepared as a Friday lunch.
                                    It is a dish of Macedonia you simply must try.</p>

                                    Burek is a remnant from the Ottoman era, dating back many centuries.
                                    This crispy thin and layered pastry traditionally contains either cheese or meat. However, nowadays, you can find pizza
                                    burek as well, containing the toppings of a regular pizza, like mozzarella and tomatoes.
                                    It’s usually served with yogurt and is an ideal grab-and-go takeaway food.

                                    Macedonians prepare hundreds of liters of rakija in their homes. They drink it not only for pleasure and special occasions,
                                    but also for alleviating the symptoms of a sore throat, cold, and muscle pain.
